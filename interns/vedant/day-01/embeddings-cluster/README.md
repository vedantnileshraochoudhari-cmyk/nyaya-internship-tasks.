# Day 01 - Embeddings Clustering Task

This project is part of my Nyaya Support internship reset task. The goal was to show that I can handle ML data properly and keep my folders organized.

## What I did:
* Generated 100 sample sentences for testing.
* Created embeddings for these sentences (stored in .npy format).
* Used KMeans to group them into 3 clusters.
* Made a PCA plot to visualize how the clusters look.
* Picked one main sentence from each cluster to show what they represent.

## How to run:
Just open the `embeddings-cluster.ipynb` and run all cells. It will automatically load the data from the /data folder and save the results.
