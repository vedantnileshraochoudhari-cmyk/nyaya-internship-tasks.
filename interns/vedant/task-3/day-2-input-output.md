# Day 2 — Inputs and Outputs

The input to this task is a list of sentences. All sentences should be text and should not be empty.

The number of sentences and the number of embeddings must be the same, otherwise clustering will not work correctly.

Embeddings should be numeric and all embeddings should have the same size.

The output of this task is a cluster label for each sentence, representative sentences for each cluster, and output files saved on disk.

If input format is wrong or files are missing, the results will be incorrect or the code will fail.
