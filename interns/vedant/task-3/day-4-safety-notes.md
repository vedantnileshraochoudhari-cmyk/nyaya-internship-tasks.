# Day 4 — Safety and Responsibility

If this code is used in a real system, I would not change anything directly without understanding it properly.

I would first test changes on sample data and check outputs before moving further.

If something is unclear or risky, I would ask for clarification instead of guessing.

I would make small changes step by step and observe the effect instead of doing everything at once.

This helps to avoid breaking the system and keeps the work safe.
